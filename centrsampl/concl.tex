\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:centrsamplconcl}
In this chapter we presented two random-sampling-based algorithms for accurately and
efficiently estimate the betweenness centrality of the (top-$K$) vertices in a
graph, with high probability. Our algorithms are based on a novel application of
VC-dimension theory, and
therefore take a different approach than previous ones achieving the same
guarantees~\citep{BrandesP07,GeisbergerSS08,JacobKLPT05}. The number of samples
needed to approximate the betweenness with the desired accuracy and confidence
does not depend on the number of vertices in the graph, but rather on a
characteristic quantity of the network that we call
\emph{vertex-diameter}. In some cases, the sample size is completely
independent from any property of the graph. %, which is interesting and unexpected. %
Our methods can be applied to many variants of betweenness, including edge
betweenness. Our algorithms perform much less work than previously presented
methods. %offering %the same approximation guarantee. 
As a consequence, they are much faster and scalable, as verified in the
extensive experimental evaluation using many real and artificial graphs. 
%In future work we would like to explore the possibility of using bidirectional
%A\textsuperscript{*} search~\citep{Pohl69,KaindlK97} to further speed up our
%algorithms.
