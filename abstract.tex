  %Thanks to technology advancements, data are nowadays being collected for
  %almost all human activities and many natural phenomena, to the point that the
  %challenge in many disciplines is the \emph{analysis} of data rather than the
  %collection of it. 
  The huge volume, high variety of origins and formats, and
  ever-increasing velocity requested when reporting results, make the
  task of analyzing the data a complex computational problem known as \emph{Big
  Data Analytics}. Traditional techniques developed in statistics are often
  insufficient, lacking scalability (\emph{volume}), speed (\emph{velocity}), or
  applicability (\emph{variety}). The thesis of this work is that it is possible
  to address these issues by using modern techniques from \emph{statistical learning
  theory} to develop and analyze of efficient randomized algorithms for
  extracting collections of interesting patterns from large transactional
  datasets and huge graphs. Problems of interest include frequent itemsets and
  association rules mining, frequent subgraphs extraction, and database queries
  selectivity estimation. The two main lines of research involve exploiting the
  trade-off between \emph{speed} and \emph{accuracy} by developing algorithms
  that only analyze small random samples of the original data, and assessing the
  \emph{statistical significance} of the extracted patterns by creating
  statistical tests that can be applied in a multiple hypothesis testing
  setting. The analysis of the algorithms uses tools from statistical learning
  theory like \emph{VC-dimension}, \emph{shatter coefficients}, and
  \emph{Rademacher averages}. A byproduct of this thesis is the evidence that
  these tools, often considered only of theoretical interest, can be of great
  use in practice. For each proposed algorithm, an extensive empirical
  evaluation assess its performances on real and artificial benchmark datasets,
  showing that their output is often of quality higher than what the theoretical
  analysis could guarantee.
