\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:parmaconc}

In this chapter we described PARMA, a parallel algorithm for mining
quasi-optimal collections of frequent itemsets and association rules in MapReduce.
We showed through theoretical analysis that PARMA offers provable guarantees on
the quality of the output collections. Through experimentation on a wide range
of datasets ranging in size from 5 million to 50 million transactions,
we have demonstrated a 30-55\% runtime improvement over PFP, the
current state-of-the-art in exact parallel mining algorithms on MapReduce.
Empirically we were able to verify the accuracy of the theoretical bounds, as
well as show that in practice our results are orders of magnitude more accurate
than is analytically guaranteed. Thus PARMA is an algorithm that can scale to
arbitrary data sizes while simultaneously providing nearly perfect results.
