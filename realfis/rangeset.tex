\section{The range space of a collection of itemsets}\label{sec:range}
In this section we define the concept of a range space associated to a
collection of itemsets and show how to bound the VC-dimension and the
empirical VC-dimension of this range space. We use these definitions and results
to develop our algorithm in later sections.

\begin{definition}\label{def:rangeset}
Given a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of itemsets built on a ground set $\Itm$, the
\emph{range space $(2^\Itm,\range(\mathcal{C}))$ associated to $\mathcal{C}$} is a range
space on $2^\Itm$ such that $\range(\mathcal{C})$ contains the support sets of
the itemsets in $\mathcal{C}$:
\[\range(\mathcal{C})=\{T(A) ~:~ A\in\mathcal{C}\}\enspace.\]
\end{definition}
This is a generalization of the range space from Def.~\ref{def:vcrangespace}.
Given a dataset $\Ds$, Thm.~\ref{lem:vcdimupperb} gives a bound to
$\EVC(\Ds,\range(\mathcal{C}))$, the \emph{empirical} VC-dimension of
$\range(\mathcal{C})$ on $\Ds$ in the following sense.

The following Theorem presents an upper bound to the empirical VC-dimension of
$\range(\mathcal{C})$ on a dataset $\Ds$.

\begin{theorem}\label{lem:evcdimupbound}
  Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a collection of itemsets and let $\Ds$ be a dataset. Let
  $d$ be the maximum integer for which there are at least $d$
  transactions $\tau_1,\dotsc,\tau_d\in \Ds$ such that the set
  $\{\tau_1,\dotsc,\tau_d\}$ is an antichain\footnote{An antichain is a
  collection of sets such no one of them is a subset of another.}, and each $\tau_i$, $1\le i\le d$,
  contains at least $2^{d-1}$ itemsets from $\mathcal{C}$. 
  %\begin{enumerate*}
  %  \item 
  %    The set $\{\tau_1,\dotsc,\tau_d\}$ is an antichain, and
  %    %For any pair of transactions $(\tau_i,\tau_j)$, $i\neq j$, we have
  %    %$\tau_i\not\subseteq\tau_j$ and $\tau_j\not\subseteq\tau_i$, and
  %  \item Each $\tau_i$, $1\le i\le d$ contains at least $2^{d-1}$ itemsets from
  %    $\mathcal{C}$.
  %\end{enumerate*}
  Then $\EVC(\Ds,\range(\mathcal{C}))\le d$.
\end{theorem}

%\ifarxiv
%\begin{proof}
%  The antichain requirement guarantees that the set of transactions considered in
%  the computation of $d$ could indeed theoretically be shattered. Assume that a
%  subset $\mathcal{F}$ of $\Ds$ contains two transactions $\tau'$ and $\tau''$
%  such that $\tau'\subseteq\tau''$. Any itemset from $\mathcal{C}$
%  appearing in $\tau'$ would also appear in $\tau''$, so there would not be any
%  itemset $A\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $\tau''\in T(A)\cap F$ but
%  $\tau'\not\in T(A)\cap \mathcal{F}$, which would imply that $\mathcal{F}$ can
%  not be shattered. Hence sets that are not antichains should not be
%  considered. This has the net effect of potentially resulting in a lower $d$,
%  i.e., in a stricter upper bound to $\EVC(\range(\mathcal{C}),\Ds)$.
%
%  Let now $\ell>d$ and consider a set $\mathcal{L}$ of $\ell$ transactions from
%  $\Ds$ that is an antichain. Assume that $\mathcal{L}$ is shattered by
%  $\range(\mathcal{C})$. Let $\tau$ be a transaction in $\mathcal{L}$.
%  The transactions $\tau$ belongs to $2^{\ell-1}$ subsets of $L$. Let
%  $\mathcal{K}\subseteq \mathcal{L}$ be one of these subsets. Since
%  $\mathcal{L}$ is shattered, there exists an itemset $A\in\mathcal{C}$ such
%  that $T(A)\cap \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{K}$. From this and the fact
%  that $t\in \mathcal{K}$, we have that $\tau\in T(A)$ or equivalently that
%  $A\subseteq\tau$. Given that all the subsets $\mathcal{K}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$
%  containing $\tau$ are different, then also all the $T(A)$'s such that
%  $T(A)\cap \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{K}$ should be
%  different, which in turn implies that all the itemsets
%  $A$ should be different and that they should all appear in $\tau$. There are
%  $2^{\ell-1}$ subsets $\mathcal{K}$ of $\mathcal{L}$ containing $\tau$,
%  therefore $\tau$ must contain at least $2^{\ell-1}$ itemsets from
%  $\mathcal{C}$, and this holds for all $\ell$ transactions in $\mathcal{L}$. This is a
%  contradiction because $\ell>d$ and $d$ is the
%  maximum integer for which there are at least $d$ transactions containing at
%  least $2^{d-1}$ itemsets from $\mathcal{C}$. Hence $\mathcal{L}$ cannot be shattered and
%  the thesis follows.
%\end{proof}

\subsection{Computing the VC-Dimension}\label{sec:computvc}
The na\"ive computation of $d$  according to the definition in Thm.~\ref{lem:evcdimupbound}
requires to scan the transactions one by one, 
compute the number of itemsets from $\mathcal{C}$ appearing in each
transaction, and make sure to consider only itemsets constituting antichains. Given the very large
number of transactions in typical dataset and the fact that the number of
itemsets in a transaction is exponential in its length, this method would be
computationally too expensive. An upper bound to $d$ (and therefore to
$\EVC(\Ds,\range(\mathcal{C}))$) can be computed by solving a
\emph{Set-Union Knapsack Problem} (SUKP)~\citep{GoldschmidtNY94} associated to
$\mathcal{C}$.
%where the elements to be put in the knapsack are organized into sets, which have a profit associated to them. The objective is to maximize 
%the number of sets for which all the elements in those
%sets were put in the knapsack
%the profit, while satisfying the capacity constraint. 

\begin{definition}[\citep{GoldschmidtNY94}]\label{def:sukp}
  Let $U=\{a_1,\dotsc,a_\ell\}$ be a set of elements and let
  $\mathcal{S}=\{A_1,\dotsc,A_k\}$ be a set of subsets of $U$, i.e.
  $A_i\subseteq U$ for $1\le i\le k$. Each subset $A_i$, $1\le i\le k$, has an associated
  non-negative \emph{profit} $\rho(A_i)\in\mathbb{R}^+$, and each element $a_j$, $1\le
  j\le\ell$ as an associated non-negative weight $w(a_j)\in\mathbb{R}^+$.
  Given a subset $\mathcal{S}'\subseteq\mathcal{S}$, we define the profit of
  $\mathcal{S}'$ as $P(\mathcal{S}')=\sum_{A_i\in \mathcal{S}'}\rho(A_i)$. Let
  $U_{\mathcal{S}'}=\cup_{A_i\in\mathcal{S}'} A_i$. We
  define the weight of $\mathcal{S}'$ as $W(\mathcal{S}')=\sum_{a_j\in
  U_{\mathcal{S}'}} w(a_j)$. Given a non-negative parameter $c$ that we call
  \emph{capacity}, the \emph{Set-Union Knapsack Problem} (SUKP) requires to find
  the set $\mathcal{S}^*\subseteq\mathcal{S}$ which \emph{maximizes}
  $P(\mathcal{S}')$ over all sets $\mathcal{S}'$ such that $W(\mathcal{S}')\le c$.
\end{definition}

In our case, $U$ is the set of items that appear in the itemsets of
$\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{C}$, the profits and the weights are all
unitary, and the capacity constraint is an integer $\ell$. We call this
optimization problem the \emph{SUKP associated to $\mathcal{C}$ with capacity
$\ell$}.
It is easy to see %It should be evident 
that the optimal profit of this SUKP is the maximum number
of itemsets from $\mathcal{C}$ that a transaction of length $\ell$ can contain.  %could fit into a transaction of length %$\ell$.
In order to show how to use this fact to compute an upper bound to
$\EVC(\Ds,\range(\mathcal{C}))$, we need to define some additional terminology. Let
$\ell_1,\dotsc,\ell_w$ be the sequence of the
\emph{transaction lengths} of $\Ds$, i.e., for each value $\ell$
for which there is at least a transaction in $\Ds$ of length $\ell$, there is
one (and only one) index $i$, $1\le i\le w$ such that $\ell_i=\ell$. Assume that
the $\ell_i$'s are labelled in decreasing order:
$\ell_1>\ell_2>\dotsb>\ell_w$. Let now $L_i$, $1\le i\le w$ be the maximum number of
transactions in $\Ds$ that have length at least $\ell_i$ and such that
for no two $\tau'$, $\tau''$ of them we have either $\tau'\subseteq\tau''$ or
$\tau''\subseteq\tau'$. Let now $q_i$ be the optimal profit of the SUKP associated to
$\mathcal{C}$ with capacity $L_i$, and let $b_i=\lfloor \log_2q_i\rfloor +1$.
The sequences $(\ell_i)_1^w$ and a sequence $(L_i^*)^w$ of upper bounds to
$(L_i)_1^w$ can be computed efficiently with a scan of the dataset. 
The following lemma uses these sequences to show how to obtain an upper bound to
the empirical VC-dimension of $\mathcal{C}$ on $\Ds$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:sukpevc}
  Let $j$ be the minimum integer for which $b_i\le L_i$. Then
  $\EVC(\Ds,\mathcal{C})\le b_j$. %We call $b_j$ the \emph{empirical b-index of
  %$\mathcal{C}$ on $\Ds$} and denote it as $\eb(\mathcal{C},\Ds)$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  If $b_j\le L_j$, then there are at least $b_j$ transactions which can contain
  $2^{b_j-1}$ itemsets from $\mathcal{C}$ and this is the maximum $b_i$ for
  which it happens, because the sequence $b_1,b_2,\dotsc,b_w$ is sorted in
  decreasing order, given that the sequence $q_1,q_2,\dotsc,q_w$ is. Then $b_j$
  satisfies the conditions of Lemma~\ref{lem:evcdimupbound}. Hence
  $\EVC(\Ds,\mathcal{C})\le b_j$.
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{lem:sukpvc}
  Let $q$ be profit of the SUKP associated to $\mathcal{C}$ with capacity
  equal to $\ell=|\{a\in\Itm ~:~ \exists A\in\mathcal{C} \mbox{ s.t. } a\in
  A\}|$ ($\ell$ is the number of items such that there is at least one itemset in $\mathcal{C}$ containing
  them).
  %$|\Itm|-1$.
  Let $b=\lfloor\log_2 q\rfloor + 1$. Then
  $\VC(2^\Itm,\range(\mathcal{C}))\le b$. %We call $b*$ the \emph{b-index of
  %$\mathcal{C}$} and denote it as $\b(\mathcal{C})$.
\end{corollary}

\paragraph{Complexity and runtime considerations.} Solving the SUKP optimally is NP-hard in the general case, although there are
known restrictions for which it can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic
programming~\citep{GoldschmidtNY94}. Since we have unit weights and unit
profits, our SUKP is equivalent to the \emph{densest $k$-subhypergraph} problem,
which can not be approximated within a factor of $2^{O(\log n)^\delta}$ for any
$\delta>0$ unless $3STA \in
DTIME(2^{n^{3/4+\varepsilon}})$~\citep{HajiaghayiJKLMRSV06}. A greedy algorithm
by~\citet{Arulselvan14} allows a constant factor approximation if each
items only appear in a constant fraction of itemsets of $\mathcal{C}$. 
%It is not clear whether our case falls into
%one of these restrictions but we found that 
For our case, it is actually \emph{not necessary to compute the optimal
solution} to the SUKP: any upper bound solution for which we can prove that
there is no power of two between that solution and the optimal solution would
result in the \emph{same upper bound} to the (empirical) VC-dimension, while
substantially speeding up the computation. This property can be specified in
currently available optimization problem solvers (e.g., CPLEX), which can then
can compute the bound to the (empirical) VC-dimension very fast even for very
large instances with thousands of items and hundred of thousands of itemsets in
$\mathcal{C}$, making this approach practical. %solution practical for our applications.

\paragraph{Refinements.} It is possible to make some refinements to our
computation of the \emph{empirical} VC-dimension of a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of
itemsets on a dataset $\Ds$. First of all, one can remove from $\mathcal{C}$ all
itemsets that never appear in $\Ds$, as the corresponding ranges can not help
shattering any set of transactions in $\Ds$. Identifying which itemsets to
remove requires a single linear scan of $\Ds$. Secondly, when computing the
capacities $L_i$ (i.e., their upper bounds $L_i^*$), we can ignore all the
transactions that do not contain \emph{any} of the itemsets in $\mathcal{C}$ (or
the filtered version of $\mathcal{C}$), as there is no way of shatter them using
the ranges corresponding to itemsets in $\mathcal{C}$. Both refinements aim at
reducing the optimal value of the SUKP associated to $\mathcal{C}$, and
therefore at computing a smaller bound to the empirical VC-dimension of
$\mathcal{C}$ on $\Ds$. We remark that these refinements can not be used when
computing the (non-empirical) VC-dimension.
%Moreover, it is actually
%not necessary to compute the optimal solution to the SUKP: any upper bound
%solution for which we can prove that there is no power of two between that
%solution and the optimal solution would result in the same upper bound to the
%(empirical) VC dimension, while substantially speeding up the computation. % of the bound.

\paragraph{The range space of all itemsets.}
The range space associated to $2^\Itm$ (seen as a collection of itemsets) is
particularly interesting for us. It is possible  %It is easy 
to compute bounds to $\VC(2^\Itm,\range(2^\Itm))$ and
$\EVC(\Ds,\range(2^\Itm))$ without having to solve a SUKP and using instead the
d-index. Indeed, these are
both consequences of Thm.~\ref{lem:vcdimupperb}. 
\begin{corollary}\label{coroll:empvcdimubfirst}
  Let $\Ds$ be a dataset with d-index $d$. Then $\EVC(\Ds,\range(2^\Itm))\le d$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}\label{coroll:vcdimubfirst}
$\VC(2^\Itm,\range(2^\Itm))=|\Itm|-1$.
\end{corollary}
